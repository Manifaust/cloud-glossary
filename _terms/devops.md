DevOps is the name attached to the commitment and efforts across different industries towards building software better and faster than in the past. Enterprises invest in DevOps to ensure the future health of their organization, to stave off agile competition, and to inovate faster than they could before.

Companies are updating their tools in order to create and deliver faster. Futhermore, they are evolving their culture to allow teams across the organization to communicate better, iterate more, and make data-driven decisions more quickly. These tools and culture are called DevOps as well.

Because DevOps involves so many elements, a platform like [Cloud Foundry](/cloud-foundry/) - which aims to tackle the challenges present in DevOps - has to solve many problems at once. This is why both topics, when explained generally can seem too abstract, and when explained in specifics can involve many pieces.
