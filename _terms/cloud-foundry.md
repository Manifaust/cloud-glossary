Also known as CF. An open source platform for deploying apps and services where developers can focus on creating a product and not about a lot of other issues that come with managing software at a huge scale.

CF manages a lot of problem related to deploying software on the [cloud](/cloud):

* automatically recovering from crashes at the process, [container](/container/), and [VM](/virtual-machine/) levels
* running your app in a container
* supporting different [IaaSes](/infrastructure-as-a-service/)
* scaling an app when it gets popular
* updating services with security patches
* updating passwords across many services and apps
* exposing services to other users in the platform
* lots of other stuff

CF is a solution to many challenges faced by [DevOps](/devops/).
