action: be ready to deploy on command
---

Also known as CD, continuous delivery is a way of developing software so that it is always ready to deploy. This means news code is continuous being tested, and verified to be successfully deployable to a testing/staging environment. By enabling continuous delivery, teams remove the obstacles getting in the way of releasing frequently, as part of working in an agile manner.

CD goes hand in hand with [CI](/continuous-integration/) and both are elements of [DevOps](/devops/).

An example of a CD tool is Concourse.
