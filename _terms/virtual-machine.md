A virtual machine is a program that emulates a computer (including the hardware). Virtual machines are useful in a variety of ways. For example, it's easier to reconfigure a virtual machine than to reconfigure an actual hardware computer. This makes it easy to organize many virtual machines with exactly the processing power you need, a necessary feature for any organization that deploys many apps and services.

Virtual Box is an example of a software that creates virtual machines on your desktop computer. AWS is Amazon's cloud platform, with the ability to create virtual machines called EC2 instances.

Bosh is the Cloud Foundry computer that spins up and manage virtual machines.
