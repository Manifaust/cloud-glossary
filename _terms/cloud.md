title: Cloud
action: servers you don't have to manage
---

Servers and services that developers can utilize but don’t have to manage themselves. More generally, the “cloud” is a catch all phrase for developing and using software with modern expectations of scale and complexity without developers having to worry about managing that complexity.

Cloud providers can include [IaaSes](/infrastructure-as-a-service/) like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Or they can be a platform that a large organization IT department can deploy such as OpenShift. To help deploy and manage apps to these clouds, an organization can use platforms like [Cloud Foundry](/cloud-foundry/).

A developer might prefer to use cloud provider (instead of organizing resources on their own) because of these features:

* quickly scaling resources based on needs
* provide service guarantees (eg. uptime)
* distributing their servers in multiple locations for speed and redundancy concerns
* security update for all users of a provider

When an organization create their own platform for allowing their developers dynamically provision services, it’s called a *private cloud*.

When an organization relies own both private and public elastic resources, it’s called a *hybrid cloud*.
