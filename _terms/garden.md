title: Garden
action: create, destroy, and control containers
---

Garden is Go client, server, and implementable API for creating and managing containers. It relies on pluggable backends that implement its interface. It is the containerization layer used by Diego.

> These interfaces contain methods to perform the following actions:
> * Create and delete containers
> * Apply resource limits to containers
> * Open and attach network ports to containers
> * Copy files into and out of containers
> * Run processes within containers
> * Stream STDOUT and STDERR data out of containers
> * Annotate containers with arbitrary metadata
> * Snapshot containers for redeploys without downtime

There are two pluggable backends:
* Guardian - Linux backend using [runC](/runc/)
* Greenhouse - Windows backend

> [â€¦] keeping containers running during a Garden-Linux upgrade, root filesystem management, integrating Cloud Foundry networking, and a simple API server. However, with Guardian the main container engine is now a very small and simple wrapper around runC.
