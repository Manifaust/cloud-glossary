title: Continuous Integration
action: constantly, automatically be testing
---

Also known as CI, the philosophy and related tools behind a way of building software where new code is constantly and automatically being tested. It also includes the belief that code from different people working on different features should be frequently _integrated_ into the mainline of work.

CI builds confidence by quickly raising attention to non-passing tests, broken integrations, and software that doesn't work on multiple environments.

CI is an important part of continuous deployment.

Some CI tools include Jenkins and Concourse.
